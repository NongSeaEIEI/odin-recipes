        <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the sauce by combining oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, black or dark soy sauce, sugar, and water. Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Pound the Thai chilies into a fine paste in a mortar and pestle, then add the garlic and the mild chilies and pound into a rough paste, just until there are no more big chunks.</li>
                <li>If using raw meat, but it into small, bite-sized pieces; make them smaller than your average stir fry as pad kra pao is not good with big chunky pieces. If using lean protein such as chicken breast, don’t slice them thinner than ½ an inch so they don’t overcook too quickly.</li>
                <li>If using raw meat, add fish sauce and mix.</li>
                <li>If using cooked protein, cut into small bite-sized pieces - here I am using a cold steak, but this can by any leftover cooked meat you have, even rotisserie chicken, roast beef, or leftover thanksgiving turkey.</li>
                <li>If using raw protein, sear it off in a very hot wok on high heat to brown the protein. Be sure to let it sit on the hot wok undisturbed until the browning develops before stirring.</li>
                <li>Remove from the pan. No need to clean the wok unless there are burnt bits stuck on it.</li>
                <li>On medium-high heat, add the chili garlic mixture and stir until the garlic starts to turn golden, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the onions and cook it for 30 seconds to a minute to soften slightly.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat up to high and add the protein and the sauce. Toss everything together just for 30 seconds or so, until the meat is well coated and heated through.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and add the holy basil, or whatever basil you're using.</li>
                <li>Toss just to wilt and that's it! Now you can make some fried eggs if you wish, and serve it with the pad kra pao on top of jasmine rice.</li>
            </ol>
